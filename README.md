# ALC-JournalApp
This is a 7 Days of Code Challenge for the ALC learners.
This application is meant for users to pen down their thoughts and feelings.

Launching the application the first time, users are required to either login into their account or register. 
Login and registration authentication is handled by firebase.

Ones you have logged in, you won't be required to login again in subsequent launch of the application. 

Journals/notes can be created, updated and deleted. To delete, users are expected to swipe the note records either to the left or right.
